      I explore <strong>lost places,</strong> take photos and build small <strong>web components.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology fascinates me, but I feel <strong>nature</strong> is my true environment.
      I think both the web and the world are made of <strong>connections</strong> - guided by a similar algorythm.
      Taking care of these connections, keeping them clean and quiet, feels like the best way to exist.

      This blog is meant to be a shelter from an overwhelming life, a blend of thoughts, projects, articles.
      Some are about code, others are... not. 
      It's my portfolio, but also my online journal. 
      The idea is to create a place where many different things can coexist naturally.
      <p><em>That's how life works.</em></p>
