    <p>I’m not sure how to define what I do — and maybe that’s the point.</p>
    <p>
      I build websites, explore forgotten places, take photos of silence, and
      spend a lot of time with my dog. Technology fascinates me, but I try to
      keep a distance from its noise. I like when things are simple, slow, and
      meaningful.

      This website is a small collection of projects, thoughts, and experiments.
      Some posts are about code, others are about ideas, photography, or just
      small observations from everyday life. It’s not a portfolio in the
      traditional sense — more like a map of what I’ve learned along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe curiosity is the most honest form of intelligence. That’s why I
      keep exploring — both online and out in the real world.
