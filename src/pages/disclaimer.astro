    <p>
        This website ("the Site") is a personal blog and portfolio operated by
        Mick. (“I”, “me”, or “my”). Your privacy is important to me, and this
        policy explains what kind of information is collected when you visit the
        Site, how it’s used, and your rights regarding that information.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Information I Collect</h3>

    <h3>2. Cookies and Analytics</h3>

    <p>
        This Site does not use tracking cookies or third-party advertising
        scripts. If analytics are used (for example, Netlify Analytics or
        Plausible Analytics), they are privacy-focused and do not store personal
        identifiers or use cookies.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing and Storage</h3>
