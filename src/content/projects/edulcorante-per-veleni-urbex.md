## Edulcorante per Veleni

Edulcorante per Veleni is my very first online **photographic project**. It started in 2018 as an Instagram page,
the project has significantly changed and has evolved over time.
The project now includes a self-developed blog (Python - Flask), a YouTube channel, and a Pinterest page. Instagram is currently being phased out.

## Aim

- Discover and document lost and hidden components of the urban environment
- Create a photographic and videographic portfolio, capturing the unique aesthetics of **decay**
- Write articles and stories about abandoned, hidden and unknown places

## Platforms

## Reflection

Edulcorante per Veleni has been a journey of personal and creative growth. Through this project, I learned to combine technical skills with storytelling, exploring abandoned urban spaces while building a cohesive online presence.

Additionally, developing the blog from scratch in Python and Flask taught me valuable lessons about web development, content management, and project maintenance.

The project also highlighted the importance of capturing not just visuals, but the stories behind each place, providing context and depth to the imagery. Over time, it helped me connect with other urban explorers and share a unique perspective on the aesthetics of decay.

Looking forward, I plan to expand Edulcorante per Veleni into a collaborative European urbex project, integrating contributions from multiple authors and exploring multilingual storytelling to reach a broader audience.
