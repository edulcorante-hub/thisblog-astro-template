## Edulcorante Blog

This project is this personal blog, a space created to combine technology, exploration, and thoughts.
Built with **Astro** and **Tailwind CSS**, it serves both as a portfolio and a personal journal.
*Edulcorante* aims to be a "Container project" for everything that it will come next.

## Aim

- Showcase articles and projects in a clean, readable layout.
- Blend professional content with personal explorations.
- Provide a calming and “zen” experience for readers.

## Features

- **Responsive design** with night mode support.
- **Dynamic components**, like pinned posts, latest projects, and a random quote generator.
- **SEO & Open Graph integration** for social sharing.
- **Netlify Forms** for contact functionality.

## Reflection

Creating this blog has been a mix of coding and design experimentation. It’s both a technical project and a personal space to document thoughts, projects, and inspirations in one unified environment.
