## The beginning

For most of the past years, I've been juggling with many hobbies, interests and projects. Many ships left my dock and most of them **drifted away**.
It is undeniable that I had enough energy to keep them alive for a while, but what I was lacked, it was a **common denominator**.
And **consistency**.
Did I found it? Well, let me explain.

## Who I am

I am Mick, I'm currently 33.
If I had to define my online identity before I would have said **"I am an Urban Exoplorer"**.
You know, that kind of people who roam around **abandoned places** to take pictures of ruins.

Am I still that?
**For sure I am!**

If you're curious about that, take a look at my urbex blog   <a href="https://edulcoranteperveleni.it" target="_blank" class="dark:text-amber-600 hover:dark:text-amber-400"> Edulcorante per Veleni</a> (in Italian).

Besides that, I'm a supporter of quiet life and I believe that **mountains** and **forests** represent my real environments.

Paloma -the dog in the cover photo- is my canine companion: she's next to me in most of my "adventures".

## So, why this blog?

Throughout my life I've tried many different things: music, photography, videography, writing, FPV drones - and more, but eventually I ended up in what makes this blog possible: **coding**.

After a brief (and quite disturbing) experience with Wordpress, I tried many platforms and then I decided to build my own using Flask, a Python framework, for my urbex blog.

## A digital safe place

I’ve realized that the digital environment has much in common with nature.  
It gives you the possibility to build your own **digital safe place** —  
a quiet corner where you have full control and can leave behind the heaviness of social networks and popular CMSs (sorry Wordpress).

Our digital identity is part of our life now.  
The way we connect has changed, and the best thing we can do is learn how to use it **wisely**.

That was my brief introduction.  
See you around!
