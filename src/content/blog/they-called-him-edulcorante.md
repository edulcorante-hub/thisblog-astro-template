## They called him "Edulcorante"

*September 2019.*

A year before this date, I overcame my rejection of **social media platforms** and decided to launch my first online project: an Instagram **urbex page** called **"Edulcorante per Veleni"**.

> **Urbex:**
> short for urban exploration,
> is the exploration of artificial structures, 
> usually abandoned ruins or hidden components 
> of the manmade environment.

After a year of posting photos, while **having absolutely no idea what I was doing**, on September 2019 I was invited to an exhibition in Milan, where my urbex videos projected in a small movie theater.

And to me **that was magic**.

## After exhibition

If my first exhibition experience was gold, what came *after* was even better.

All together around a table, finally enjoying a typical *cotoletta alla milanese* and putting faces to the I've been talking to online for months.

Even though we had introduced ourselves earlier, suddenly I realized something.

"I'm here with Edulcorante!"
"Look, Edulcorante is here! Come!"

## My project ate my identity - I became *The Project*

It really happened.

At that time, I didn't pay much attention to it. And not only: I was even proud of it.

I thought I had finally found **something I was good at**, something for which **I would be recognized**.

But after a while, I realized that my project was actually consuming my identity.
I had to fit its limits, follow its tone, obey its rules.
And I couldn’t even start something new — I was too afraid of contaminating what I had become and of stepping outside **the cage of expectations**.

## Something I learned - *unrequested tips*

### 1. Doing many different things is fine

It might sound obvious, but in the era of **hyper-specialization** it's easy to fall into this trap. 

We don't have to always focus on **just a single thing**. You can have multiple interests, different projects and they don't all need to connect perfectly.

If you think that this might be a form of *lack of coherence*, well, it is not.

### 2. Cultivate your work, but cultivate yourself too

Read. Watch movies. Go for a walk.

Put distance between you and your work from time to time.

Feed your mind and give yourself a break when everything is overwelming. *It won't harm*, *it will heal*.

### 3. Go out

IIt’s technically part of point no. 2, but it deserves its own space.

Nothing resets your perspective like stepping outside.
Even a short walk, a conversation, a random detail on the street — these moments reconnect you to the world outside your own head.
That’s where new ideas start.

All good and new things are coming from outside.

## My attempt

In the end, I’ve isolated the identity in which i found myself — and I made it **mine**.
I stopped fighting the label and started reshaping it, opening space for new directions and different paths - not every time clear ones.
Every day, I still fight against the **absence of meaning**, against that **familiar sense of being lost**.
But maybe that’s what makes all of this alive.

And if what I create may seem disconnected, fragmented, or not always coherent... well, that’s exactly what I am.

**That’s what we all are.**
